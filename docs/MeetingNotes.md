their posts. 



   

## Nov 4, 2023
**Recorded by:** Daniel     
**Scrum master:** Turjo      
**Venue:** CS Student Lab  
**Time:** 10:30 AM - 1:30 PM  
**Attendance:** Caleb, Daniel, Turjo,

**Progress (progress) Since Last Meeting**  
1) Daniel has almost finished setting up multi-session. Just need to be able to destroy cookies to end sessions.  
2) Daniel has almost finished CSS code.  
3) Caleb rehauled the userDatabase.db file to add a user, review, draft, and rating table. Added code for the draft functionality for draft and saving. Added code for saving ratings and retrieving. Calculation of avg. rating for each review functionality added.  
4) Implemented partial match searches by “username” or “topic”. Also implemented a share button to share your current link to social media.    

**Professor's Suggestions & Topics To Discuss**  
1) Discuss changes to the database.  
2) Discuss the UML Architecture of our project  
3) Outline the architecture document incorporating updated modules interfaces for current sprint  
4) review architecture document contributions  

**Decisions**  
1) We went through the UML notes together and decided we would create an evolving UML diagram as we designed our application. Since the purpose of this project is to learn, we didn’t want to pigeonhole ourselves into a specific architecture.   
2) Caleb explained basics of SQL and the properties behind it.   
3) Caleb’s code pull request denied. Needs further refinement.   
4) Turjo’s code works well. Pull request accepted. Deadline met.  
5) Daniel’s deadline set to Monday. Daniel must submit multisession and new CSS. Caleb’s new deadline by Monday. Must refine/finish implementing SQL and submit.  
6) Tanjet’s pull request denied as it causes conflict with existing code. New deadline is by Monday.   

**Difficulties (difficult)**
1) Daniel: having issues with multiple actions/submits in html/bottle. One submit overrides the other submit. Delays CSS/HTML delivery.    
2) Caleb: Some SQL methods may have potential of entanglement. Will resolve by Monday.  
3) Turjo: no issues. all code working  
4) Tanjett: absent 

**Code Review (review)**  
1) Reviewed Caleb’s code for changes in database.py  
- Daniel: new code save_draft() could be a little more descriptive. Such as save_draft_by_user_name(). Get_average_rating has code that needs decoupling and code separation.  
- Turjo: raised doubt if these new methods will cause entanglement or complications due to inconsistencies.

2) Reviewed Caleb’s code for changes in SQL  
- Daniel: Currently SQL allows multiple drafts, but that might be a bad idea HTML side.

3) Reviewed Turjo’s code. Turjo added Share-URL and Search-by-title and Search-by-author functionality.  
- Daniel: Both functions look great. Styling will be needed, which I will handle. Good to merge.
- Turjo: Don’t know CSS, so will pass on the styling to Daniel.  
- Caleb: Functions work properly. Good to merge.

**Recorded by:** Daniel  
**Venue:** DISCORD  
**Time:** 10:00 PM - 10:20 PM  
**Attendance:** Caleb, Daniel, Turjo  
Points of discussion/issues:
1) Difficulty from Daniel. While looking through all the code, Daniel discovered that rating buttons aren’t working properly.     
2) For the rating buttons to work, Daniel asked Caleb to re-implement the SQL, because currently, the some methods are missing. Deadline by tomorrow Nov 9.    
3) Save draft user side feature is not implemented, Turjo volunteered to implement it. Deadline by tomorrow Nov 9.    
4) STUB: Daniel and Caleb discussed and produced STUB for rating feature. Pushed by Daniel. 

## Nov 9, 2023  
**Recorded by:** Daniel     
**Scrum master:** Caleb      
**Venue:** CS Student Lab    
**Time:** 1:00 PM - 3:50 PM    
**Attendance:** Caleb, Daniel, Turjo, Tanjet      
Decision:   
- Caleb will delete Daniel’s stub and implemented a working rating feature. Wasn’t able to finish by meeting time, but will try to finish it before the end of the day.   
- We will meet tomorrow and work on the UML, Readme, unit tests, and etc tomorrow.  
- Turjo merged his code for the upgraded draft functionality. Turjo also merged his code  for “share” feature as Daniel accidentally  deleted it last week.   

Difficulty: Everyone is having a difficulty because of accidental merge of duplicate lines of text from the merge from Turjo. (Immediate Solution: Turjo identified the solution and re-pushed.)  


## Nov 9, 2023
**Recorded by:** Caleb       
**Venue:** DISCORD    
**Time:** 9:30 PM - 9:45 PM    
**Attendance:** Caleb, Daniel  
- Daniel Reviewed (review) Caleb's progress. Caleb has shifted the database a little, and the average rating calculation works without error.

- Discovered bug from draft function. Bug fix task assigned to Turjo.  



Meeting Nov 10
## Nov 10, 2023
**Recorded by:** Daniel  
**Scrum master:** Daniel         
**Venue:** DISCORD      
**Time:** 10:40 AM - 12:30 PM      
**Attendance:** Caleb, Daniel, Turjo, Tanjett    
**Details/Decisions:**  
- In this meeting we discussed the issues of decoupling and SOLID/solid. Caleb said that any calculation methods we have should be decoupled out of any feature functions we have, encapsulated in a “helper” class. Daniel explained to teammates that the submit() method in routes.py has potential of decoupling as it goes over 20 lines. We will work on that in the beginning of the third cycle.    
- During the meeting, we worked on the process model, Unit test, UML, Doc String, Readme, model analysis  and Comments together.  We used GoogleDrive to merge our parts of the collaborative tasks. To avoid merge conflicts each person will push the different component from our google Drive.    
  These people will push the following:    
    -* Unit Test: Turjo     
    -* UML: Caleb   
    -* Component Architecture Document: Caleb    
    -* Readme: Caleb    
    -* Model Analysis: Tanjet    
    -* DocStrings: individually pushed.    

- DIFFICULTY: our meetings average to about 2-3 hours each time. Last week one meeting went 4 hours. Too many things to discuss due to too many, detailed marking scheme.   
- Add to Kanban that our meetings take too long.  
- Tanjett and Calebl decided to add stubs for future implementations.  
- Performance review deadline set to Nov 10 by the end of the day.

- Still working on decoupling for route.py file for further optimization and simplification.

**Code Review:**  

*Caleb’s Code:*  

- Turjo: The changes appear seamless and conflict-free. It looks good and is ready for merging.
- Daniel: Thanks for updating the DB. It follows the attributes, exactly as we discussed in our meetings.

*Tanjett’s Code:*  
- Daniel: Looks good no conflicts found. Cleaning up the code is great. I think cleaning up code is better near the end of the cycle.
- Caleb: stub implementation looks good. He made some spacing changes in the code, but nothing dysfunctional. 
- Turjo: While there are just a few added lines, I suggest creating a separate commit and pull request to clean things up and align with our guidelines. This way, our changes will be more organized, and we can have confidence that the existing code remains intact. As it stands, everything looks great—the stub isn't introducing any inconsistencies. Ready for merging!

## Dec 1, 2023
**Recorded by:** Tanjet
**Scrum master:** Turjo  
**Venue:** Discord  
**Time:** 3:00 PM - 3:50 PM  
**Attendance:** Caleb, Daniel, Turjo, Tanjet 

**Professor's Suggestions & Topics To Discuss:**
- Discuss current progress and merge pull requests.
- Discuss any further possible decoupling of code.
- Discuss Deadlines

**Difficulties:**  
- Struggled to find more ways to decouple our code. At the application's current state, it may due more harm than good.

**Decoupling/Solid:**  
- route.py action handlers methods such as rate() can use decoupling, but other handlers such as checkCredential(), 
Save, comment, login and many other handlers will not see any benefit of decoupling.
Verdict: Due to too many data sets being called via request.forms and simple data processing, there is more harm to 
breaking up route.py to 2 files (app_logic.py and route.py (http request)). 
Decoupling of route.py will not commence.

**Progress Report:**
- Caleb: Removed  save_by_draft function in the database.py file as it is not useful to the program. Also tidied up several 
pieces of code in the .py files.

**Code Review:**

*Caleb's code*
- Turjo: Good job tidying the code. It looks better now.
- Daniel: Thanks for wiping out the unnecessary things from the code. it looks now more nice and polished.

- Nothing to report

**Progress Report:**
- Turjo: Updated the stub functionality and HTML code for editing a review submission. Also removed some debugging code.

**Code Review:**

*Turjo's code*
- Daniel: view My Post re-direct button could be better on a different page like 'profile' or 'write-review' page. 
That's where most people I would argue to go find their own information. Having that button in public is not terrible, 
so maybe the 'view-my-post' button could reside in all three pages. Most ideally, we need a side bar or a drop down menu 
to access this (added to backlog).
- Caleb: The code is functional but could be more optimized. Good to merge
- Tanjet: The code and methods look and work fine. Good to merge.
* Note - We all agreed with Daniel suggestion and Turjo implemented My Post re-direct button in all three pages on spot.
