## Project Progress and Approach:
Our team has made significant progress in developing the Performance Review web-based app. 
Turjo has successfully set up the server, enabling seamless communication for our application. 
Daniel has constructed the HTML and implemented a robust templating engine, providing a foundation for the app's frontend logic. 
Caleb has established the data store and object mapping, crucial for managing and organizing our application's data.
Tanjeet has been instrumental in developing user info and security features, focusing on safeguarding user data and access. 

Currently, we have a functional server and a structured HTML layout for the application. 
Connections between various components are established, allowing us to access essential user information through the implemented logic.


* During our SCRUM meetings, we consistently present and discuss code contributions. The entire team is informed about the progress and actively participates in discussions.

* We have prioritized adherence to SOLID principles and de-coupling to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase.

* Before merging any code, a comprehensive review is conducted. We did this to catch potential issues and validate the code.

* We have successfully established and enforced pull request deadlines. 

## Future Plans:
Moving forward, we plan to collaboratively work on the application's logic to integrate the server functionality with the HTML structure.
We will implement the app's logic, and focus on user information and security features.

## Project Progress and Approach:

In the first sprint of our Performance Review web-based app, we've successfully completed all the initial requirements. 
Our application now boasts a fully functional database where users can create their accounts, ensuring that no duplicate 
usernames are allowed. Users can log in securely with their credentials and access their personal review page. All published 
reviews are displayed on the public review page.

This sprint served as our project's foundational setup. It was a learning experience where we had to grasp several new concepts.

We operated as a team of four, as one member had to drop the course, but we are now well-prepared for the upcoming sprints.

Caleb skillfully handled the database setup, ensuring its reliability. Daniel crafted all the necessary HTML files and
contributed significantly to the logic. Turjo managed the routing and made substantial contributions to unit testing.
Tanjeet played a pivotal role in building the logic and maintaining documentation.

We meticulously followed our professor's guidelines throughout the process, conducting regular code reviews. Each team
member actively participated in the development, and all pull requests underwent thorough review. We upheld the principles
of SOLID and de-coupling, which were emphasized in our class.

## Future Plans:
As we progress into the next sprint, our focus is on enhancing the database to make it more sophisticated. We plan to
introduce the ability for users to save multiple drafts, adding more features to the public review page, and improving 
the overall user-friendliness of the web app. With the successful completion of the foundational sprint, we're well-prepared 
to tackle these more advanced tasks and create a robust, feature-rich application.

## Project Progress and Approach:
The second sprint of our Performance Review web-based app has seen remarkable advancements, pushing our project closer to a refined and feature-rich state. This sprint was marked by significant enhancements to the database, making it more sophisticated and capable of handling complex functionalities.

Key Achievements:

Multisession Capability: We have successfully implemented multisession functionality, allowing users to maintain multiple sessions simultaneously. This feature enhances user experience and operational flexibility.

Enhanced Database Functionality: Our database now supports more complex operations, enabling better data management and efficiency.

New Features Added:

Drafts: Users can now save multiple drafts of their reviews, providing flexibility in content creation and management.

Rating System: We introduced a rating system for reviews, allowing users to rate each other's contributions, fostering a community-driven approach.

Share Review Functionality: Users have the option to share their reviews, increasing engagement and interactivity within the app.

Change Password Feature: Enhancing security, we have added a change password feature, allowing users to update their credentials easily.

Each of these features was developed with a focus on robustness, user-friendliness, and security. Our team worked collaboratively, ensuring each component was integrated seamlessly with the existing infrastructure.

Throughout the sprint, we maintained our commitment to the SOLID principles and code de-coupling, ensuring our codebase remains maintainable and scalable. Every code contribution underwent a rigorous review process, and all team members actively participated in the development and review process.

## Future Plans:
For our final sprint in this course project, we're focusing on refining and enhancing our Performance Review web app:

Codebase Optimization: Streamlining the code for better performance and stability.

Final Feature Additions: Implementing user-centric features for improved interaction and security.

User Experience Enhancement: Polishing the user interface to ensure an intuitive and engaging user experience.

Our team is excited to wrap up with a high-quality, user-friendly application that showcases our skills and meets project goals.

## Project Progress and Approach:
During our final sprint for the COMP2005 course project, we not only fine-tuned our web application but also expanded our architectural documentation to reflect the advanced stages of our development 
process. We introduced a new component architecture document enriched with an updated UML diagram that provides a detailed depiction of our application's structure. We also revisited our development process, creating a new process analysis
diagram that captures the essence of our workflow and the methodologies employed throughout the project lifecycle.

Our progress was marked by several milestones:
- The development and inclusion of a comprehensive microservice architecture design, offering a hypothetical alternative to our existing components-based approach, showcasing how our application could be evolved in the future.
- Finalization of core features like user profile management, edit exiting post, comment functionality and anonymous reviews, ensuring functional completeness and user privacy.
- Enhanced session management and a polished user interface, culminating in a secure and seamless user experience.
- Thorough testing procedures, affirming the application’s readiness for deployment and its adherence to our high standards for quality and reliability.


The approach we've taken reflects the sophisticated practices explored in our coursework, with a strong emphasis on scalability, maintainability, and adherence to industry-standard architectural patterns.

## Future Plans:
As this sprint concludes our active development phase, we have equipped our project with extensive documentation that showcases our growth as a team and our application’s robust architecture. The inclusion of the microservice architecture 
design in our final documentation serves as a testament to our ability to adapt and plan for scalable solutions.

Looking ahead, we intend to:

- Apply our understanding of both component-based and microservice architectures in future software endeavors, leveraging the versatility and depth of our skills.
- Use the comprehensive documentation, including our microservice architecture design, as a reference model for best practices in software development.
- Maintain the agile and collaborative team dynamics that have underpinned the success of this project, recognizing their value in future group collaborations.

While there are no immediate plans to continue the development of this application as it is a course project, the skills, knowledge, and teamwork experiences we have gained are invaluable assets that we will carry forward into our professional careers. 
The project stands as a beacon of our collective learning and a springboard for our future endeavors in the tech industry.
