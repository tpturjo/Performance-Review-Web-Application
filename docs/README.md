# Performance Review Web Application

The web application created by our team is a cohesive platform that streamlines the process of writing, managing, and sharing reviews. 
It's built on a client-server model utilizing HTML/CSS for the front-end and the Bottle framework for server-side operations, underpinned by a 
SQLite database for data persistence. Key features include account management, password security, review drafting, and publishing with anonymous 
options, as well as interactive elements like comment systems and rating functionalities. The architecture ensures usability with an intuitive 
interface, maintainability through modular design, and testability via comprehensive API and unit tests. Scalability is anticipated, albeit with 
careful consideration of database load and session management.

# Description of Application/Project

- Our Performance Review application is a dynamic web-based platform designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, 
and evaluating performance reviews. At the core of the application is a robust Python backend, with key scripts such as database.py 
for database interactions, route.py for request handling, and user.py for user data management. These scripts work in tandem with a 
userDatabase.db SQLite database, which houses essential tables like Users, Reviews, and Drafts, facilitating efficient data manipulation.

- The application's architecture is meticulously laid out in our Process Model Analysis Text Document and accompanied by a comprehensive 
Process Model Analysis Diagram. Together, they provide an in-depth look at the application's workflow and the interconnections between its 
various components.

- Running the application is straightforward thanks to the if __name__ == '__main__': block within the route.py file, which serves as the entry 
point for the server. With the simplesqlite plugin, stakeholders can easily inspect the database tables to monitor how data is managed and 
maintained throughout the application's lifecycle.

- The application's front-end is designed for ease of use, with HTML templates and CSS styling ensuring a user-friendly interface. This is 
supported by the server-side logic that not only authenticates users but also allows for the secure creation, editing, and publishing of 
reviews, including draft saving and anonymous submissions.

- In essence, this application embodies a harmonious blend of functionality and user experience, bolstered by a well-documented and scalable 
architecture.


# Additional Important Information

- We each had our assigned tasks and sections but we also assisted each other when we could. This allowed us to each 
understand the program better as a whole, while still being able to specialize in one or a few key roles.

- Unit tests (As well as other documents (microservice, Architecture, etc) were uploaded by one member of the group, but they were 
developed by all members of the group during our last several meetings.

- Code was reviewed by members of the group before it was merged into the project. Some members added comments later, 
but we never merged code that wasn't first reviewed and approved.


# Unit Tests

- Within our project, unit_test.py plays a pivotal role, encompassing a broad spectrum of tests that scrutinize every component, from user 
authentication mechanisms to data retrieval and API functionality. In parallel, our Postman suite, detailed in term-project-teamm.postman_collection.json, 
executes a series of API tests, ensuring that all endpoints meet our stringent criteria for reliability and performance. This dual-faceted testing 
strategy guarantees comprehensive coverage, and by employing continuous regression testing, we maintain the integrity of the system against new 
changes. The regression tests are designed to detect any discrepancies early on, preventing the introduction of bugs and ensuring that new code 
merges do not disrupt existing functionalities. This rigorous testing regimen is integral to our development lifecycle, instilling confidence in 
the stability of our application with each sprint and release.


- The user.py file did not require unit tests since it only contains setter and getter methods for the data in the
userDatabase.db file.


# Docstrings

- Throughout our project, every piece of code is meticulously annotated with docstrings, adhering to PEP8 and PEP257 standards. This practice 
 has been consistently applied across all scripts, including database.py, route.py, and user.py, ensuring that each function, class, and module 
is accompanied by clear, concise descriptions. These docstrings not only facilitate easier understanding and maintenance of the code but also 
serve as an invaluable guide for future developers interacting with our application. By strictly following these Python documentation 
conventions, we have significantly enhanced the readability and standardization of our codebase, contributing to the overall quality and 
sustainability of the project.


# Meeting Notes

- Meeting notes can be found in the MeetingNotes.md file. Path docs/MeetingNotes.md
- We took turns writing the meeting notes during the sprint. We also took turns filling the role of scrum master. In the meeting notes you can see who participated in each of these roles during each meeting.
- Meeting notes contain information on note takes and scrum master, attendance, discussions made, decisions made, progress made, and code reviews

- To streamline the review of these notes and enhance accessibility, we have incorporated specific keywords, enabling efficient navigation 
through the document. These include:

  - Stub Implementation: Searchable through the keyword "stub/Stub," these sections detail our approach to developing and integrating stubs into our application.
  - Code Review: Using "review/Review," this part reflects our thorough analysis and feedback on code contributions, ensuring quality and adherence to project standards.
  - Progress Report/ Regular Reports of Tasks: Found with "report/Report," these segments offer insights into ongoing tasks and responsibilities assigned to team members.
  - Discussion of SOLID Principles and Decoupling: Accessible via "decouple/Decouple," these notes focus on our adherence to SOLID principles and efforts towards decoupling components for better modularity.
  - Difficulties Encountered: Located using "difficult/Difficult," this section candidly discusses any challenges faced and the solutions employed.
  - Daily Progress: Marked by "progress/Progress," these entries provide a day-to-day account of our project's advancement.
