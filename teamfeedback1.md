## Project Sprint 1 Evaluation credit, CS2005 F2023

## General Feedback

* I saw the statement about expecting code review materials is seeming unfair, it is good to get that feedback, I am not sure how I can adjust the marking scheme for sprint 1 at this point, but I will try to post more clarifying material on this matter. Be sure to let me know where else the lecture material is lacking or seems unfair and will try to respond in a positive manner.
* You are using the design label on KanBan a little differently than I was thinking - I was saving it for interface design activity, so that's what I meant by a design task. 
* It would help to clarify the breakdown of features into tasks so I can trace the relationship (could be in kanban or notes, or maybe both.)
* You seem to be the best organized team at this point due to the clarity of the documentation and organization of the repo.

## Team submission

Team submission evaluation will be based on the following:

* The README file in your repo will be read by the marker to run the program, unit tests, and find out what other documentation the evaluator should read. It is your responsibility to tell the marker how to find the evaluation components, it is not the marker's responsibility to hunt through the documents and code to find those items.
  * The content of the Kanban Board, issue tracker, and repo will be reviewed
  * Other documents should be put in a documents folder in your repo and indicated in README file, if they should be read for marking assessment
  * If you are using other github tools that need to be reviewed (e.g. discussion or wiki tools) make sure this is made clear to the evaluator in the repo README file.

* Evaluation components will include:
  * Properly minuted SCRUM meetings and decisions (40%)
    * **5/5 points** agenda coverage for each meeting
    * **10/10 points** includes progress on agenda items suggested by prof on class diary/webpage
    * **4/5 points** decisions documented properly and reflected in the Kanban Board/issue tracker
      * Don't forget you can include 
    * **5/5 points** architecture and low level designs (interfaces) discussed, determined, and documented.
      *  architecture document in docs folder
    * **5/5 points** SCRUM master and notetaker roles shared among team
    * **5/5 points** Minutes committed and pushed regularly, so team members can access.
      * I accept your explanation about a word document, but why isn't it in the repo as well?
    * **4/5 points** Features broken into tasks. Design interface/services and Coding tasks assigned to individual team members. Tasks on KanBan board.
      * feature v. coding task distinction is mostly clear, but which tasks belong to which features?
  * Maintenance of the Kanban Board on your team github page and the issue tracker in your project repository (15%)
    * Kanban board must be set up early in the first cycle. 
    * **2/2 points** Establish labels, color coding, and categories for the Kanban board cards and issues. 
    * **5/5 points** Create cards for backlog features, required functionality for sprint 1, and assigned tasks.
    * **4/4 points** Progress of tasks noted on board
    * **2/4 points** New tasks and issues arising in meetings, reviews and otherwise are noted on kanban board
      * You can use board for process activities and tracking effort that is not about coding; you do some of this, (go through marking scheme, e.g) but some activity in notes the follow-up is not provided (e.g. make code more efficient). Consider using board for some of these.
  * Performance reviews (how did the team members perform) conducted and documented (15%)
    * **5/5 points** Each team member assessed, each team member participates.
    * **4/5 points** Serious performance reviews including problems/personality clashes and possible solutions. A trivial review indicating everyone did fine will be assumed to be pro-forma and will be given no credibility.
      * While this seems to be a genuinely good working group, you need to dig deeper in review to see how your might suggest improvements.
    * **4/5 points** Problems with the team progress, dynamics and process must be identified and documented, and tracked with possible responses and progress on those items becoming kanban/agenda items.
      * I partly waive this mark. b/c you genuinely seme to have no problems and I can;t fault the first sprint results. But you can always strive to improve something, what could it be for your group?
  * Code reviews conducted and documented. (20 %)
    * **_I am sensitive to your complaint about the clarity of expectations around code reviews, so I can accept your description of activity at face value. However, I cannoot give full credit without seeing some material outcome from code reviews._**
      * Code should be regularly presented and discussed at SCRUM meetings, not just at end of cycle.
      * **2/3 points** Code contributions are presented to entire team.
      * **2/10 points** Code reviews are thorough, covering style issues (SOLID, de-coupling) as well as correctness.
        * No direct evidence this was done.
      * **5/5 points** All code should be reviewed before pull request is merged.
      * **0/2 points** Pull request deadlines established and enforced.
        * You claim this was done, but I could not locate the decision in the meeting notes. Also I see new PRs issued on the last day, so I don't think you have enforcement of a deadline in that case.
  * User Stories (15 %)
    * **5/5 points** One story per team member, yielding at least two suggested features from each story.
    * **4/5 points** User stories are complete and good quality
      * The Sarah story was weak, it really is just a list of features without any kind of episodic narrative motivating them. SOme of the others have similar weakness, but overall a good collection of stories.
    * **5/5 points** Each user story generated two original features that are added to the board backlog
      * You do have a few features that are not obvious and need a story to motivate them. I like!

* **87/105 points** TOTAL
